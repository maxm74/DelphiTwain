      Initial translation, based on twain.h, version 1.8

   Version 1.8.1: 12.09.99 - UT
      SizeOf for all structures checked and corrected.
      (Alignment is 2 Bytes for the C Code and 'packed record' uses
      1 Byte alignment. Only types using TW_xINT8 are affected)

   Version 1.8.2: 19.12.99 UT
      Added MPL and the other JEDI Statements
      Added EXTERNALSYMS to support C++ Builder
      Created the .PAR file (no Unicode things are used by the TWAIN API?)
      A bit better formatting of the source

   Version 1.8.3: 20.12.99
      MT: Added Delphi-Aliases to the structures (like TTWFrame = TW_FRAME)
      UT: Added missing Externalyms for some constants

   Version 1.9.0: 01.12.00
      MO: Updated translation to conform with twain.h 1.9

   Version 2.0.0: 26.06.09
      LM: Forced $ALIGN 2, removed 'packed' and paddings from all records.
          SizeOf and member offsets for all structures checked ok.
          Changed some variables to use types from System unit
          rather than from Windows unit.
          Maybe beautified code.
